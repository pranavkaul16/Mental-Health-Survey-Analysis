# Mental-Health-Survey-Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for conducting an exploratory analysis of mental health data. The analysis aims to understand factors influencing mental well-being in a random group of 48 individuals.
The dataset used for this analysis includes anonymized information collected from the sampled population. It includes demographic data, lifestyle habits, self-reported mental health status, and other relevant variables.
Through our analysis, we aim to uncover insights into the distribution of mental health status, relationships between demographic and lifestyle factors, and patterns in coping strategies used by individuals with different mental health statuses. The findings are summarized in the notebook and visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.
